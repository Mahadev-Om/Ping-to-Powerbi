# Tweetbeats
Built a full-scale behavioral analytics engine using tweet metadata to reveal when, where, and how users engage. This project showcases advanced EDA, time slicing, geovisualization, and interaction pattern modelingâ€”laying the groundwork for recommender systems, virality prediction, and campaign optimization.

This project extracts deep behavioral and temporal trends from a Twitter dataset using advanced EDA techniques. Designed to uncover the hidden rhythms of social interaction.

## Highlights
- Engineered features from timestamps for temporal pattern mining
- Computed like/retweet intensity per user to gauge engagement
- Modeled hourly/daily tweet behavior and geo-distribution

## Tech Stack
`Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Python`, `Social Media Dataset`, `Datetime Analysis`, `Frequency Modeling`

## Business Use Cases
- Audience segmentation
- Peak activity time targeting
- Geo-specific social campaign planning
